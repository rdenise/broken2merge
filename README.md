# Broken2merge

## Description
The `broken2merge` software is designed to concatenate the genes that belong to the same species but appear to be broken due to assembly issues. It provides a solution for merging fragmented gene sequences into a single, complete sequence.

## Features
- Gene concatenation: `broken2merge` identify and merge fragmented gene sequences into a single, continuous sequence.
- Assembly error detection: `broken2merge` includes error detection mechanisms to identify and handle assembly errors, ensuring accurate gene concatenation.

## Installation
To install `broken2merge`, follow these steps:

### Install with pipy:

```bash
pip install broken2merge
```

## Usage

To use `broken2merge`, follow these steps:

1. Import the `broken2merge` module:
   ```python
   import broken2merge
   ```

2. Load the gene sequences:
   ```python
    sequences = broken2merge.load_sequences('sequences.fasta')
    ```

3. Merge the sequences:
    ```python
     merged_sequences = broken2merge.merge_sequences(sequences)
     ```

4. Save the merged sequences:
    ```python
    broken2merge.save_sequences(merged_sequences, 'merged_sequences.fasta')
    ```

## Example
Here's an example of how to use `broken2merge` to merge gene sequences:

```python
import broken2merge

# Load the gene sequences
sequences = broken2merge.load_sequences('sequences.fasta')
```
